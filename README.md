# Ray Tracer
Ray tracer using OpenGL's Compute Shader

Rendered scenes are static images (not real-time)

- Loads vertex data from a .obj file (vertex data only)
- Sends the loaded vertex data to a compute shader (CPU sends data to GPU)
- Compute shader simulates rays emminating from the user's screen from each pixel (at angles such that parallax is simulated accurately)
- These rays are tested for intersection with the object in the scene (represented by the vertex data)
- Rays can be set to bounce 0 to 3 times (this creates levels of reflections)
- Compute shader sends data back to CPU process which saves the data to an image

Credit: Seth implemented most of the GPU related code and made the shaders, Nick implemented .obj file loading and CPU rendering.
